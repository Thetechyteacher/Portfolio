How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Researched visualy pleasing UX and UI designs for this project to optimize the visual side of the website, creating a clean and crisp look which is user-friendly and easy to follow. The website is fully accesible as well, having a dark mode available for those who want one. 
Dark mode preference gets saved on the user local storage, saving the user from having to click on the dark mode button when accessing again. 


Lessons Learned:

UX and UI design have taken a priority in this project, along with accessibility.
